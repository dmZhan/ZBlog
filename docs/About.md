# About me and the blog

## About me

A student who only knows crud for the time being,
technically interested in ***Web Development, Server O&M, and Network Penetration Testing***.

I am also very interested in ACG and have the wealth of animation viewing experience.

My id is taken from the song ***[aikotoba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WptXk39wiIQ)*** of **[DECO*27](https://www.youtube.com/@DECO27)**.

Since GitHub Pages offers free servers and my domain name costs less than $15 per year, you can trust that my blog will be around for a long time to come.

## Language/Framework
